            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ethiene Boco. I grew up in the <abbr title= "Philippines">PH</abbr> and spent most of my childhood there. The country has 2 seasons unlike Canada: <em>Rainy and Dry seasons</em>. The rainy season is from June to November, while the dry season is from December to May. Since it is located near the equator the temperature could go up to 30<sup>o</sup>C or higher. It's so hot that even after you take a shower, you would be sweating in no time (based on real experience). What I can say about the Philippines is that it has the best malls (better than Canada), it has lots of beaches and food is very delectable!</p>

            <p>I have 2 hobbies: <em>doing art and gaming</em>. Most of the time I game during my free time. One of the main reasons why I like video games is because I grew up with it. The genres I like the most are JRPGs, open world games and hack & slash. So far the only games I've completed and re-played before are Persona 5 Royal and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I am currently completing Persona 4 Golden, Final Fantasy XV (already on the last chapter), Final Fantasy VII: Remake, Octopath Traveler and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of a Kingdom. Unfortunately, I am not good at shooting games, but I do enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2 a lot.</p>
