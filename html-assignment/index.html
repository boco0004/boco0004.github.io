            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ethiene Boco. I grew up in the <abbr title= "Philippines">PH</abbr> and spent most of my childhood there. The country has 2 seasons unlike Canada: <em>Rainy and Dry seasons</em>. The rainy season is from June to November, while the dry season is from December to May. Since it is located near the equator the temperature could go up to 30<sup>o</sup>C or higher. It's so hot that even after you take a shower, you would be sweating in no time (based on real experiences). What I can say about the Philippines is that it has the best malls (better than Canada), it has lots of beaches and that the food is very delectable!</p>
